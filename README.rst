PeRKy_ is a computer software dedicated to management of software requirements
with any `Source Control Manager`_ (abbreviated *SCM*) as storage layer, based
on a simple principle: **1 file per requirement**.

PeRKy helps users to keep documentation in sync with their developments by
using the same tools than the one they use for code. It also integrates
notions of distributed development and thus highly limitates the risk of
encountering conflicts when merging branches of development.
